<h2 id="data"> Data Availability & Setup</h2>

This replication builds upon the original dataset from the *“Playing to the Gallery”* study. Because of file size limitations on GitHub, the data files cannot be committed directly to this repository. To access the necessary files:

* Please download the original data from the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QDTLYV" target="_blank">
      Harvard Dataverse
    </a>
  as specified by the authors.
* Additionally, all files used in this <code>replication—uk_data</code>, the extended version <code>uk_data_clean</code>, and <code>corpus.txt</code> used for Word2Vec training—are hosted on     <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l8mttWYBo1k-GKExBtYCS9ogwWZ5ZTyF?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto" target="_blank">

    </a>
 for convenience. These include preprocessed text, learned embeddings, and model outputs.

> **Note:** The `uk_data_clean` file is the extended version of the original dataset that includes additional variables engineered during replication—such as tokenized speeches, cleaned text, emotion scores, and model predictions. Its larger size reflects these enhancements in vocabulary captured for training.
